Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This\n * allows the creation of custom validation functions.
